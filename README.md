# Categorizing-Animal-Species-in-the-Wild
# The purpose of this project  is to develop a model that effectively classifies animals trapped by camera traps taken in different  observation locations in the world .Camera traps are widely used by Biologists and Ecologists to get the images of the animals without disturbing the wildlife .Due to camera traps,animal image collection sped up but manually analyzing and processing the images is taking more time.
 #  The present work aims to scrutinize the performance of deep learning models for classification of animal specie
